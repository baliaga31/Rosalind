# Rosalind

Rosalind (http://rosalind.info/) is a very good website to learn python and bioinformatics. These exercices are divided into four groups: 

1. Python Village
2. Bioinformatics Stronghold
3. Bioinformatics Armory
4. Algorithmic Heights

I started to do the exercices in these two groups. In this Github, you will find my solutions to these bioinformatic problems. If you see some errors or better way to improve my code, don't hesitate to mail me.
